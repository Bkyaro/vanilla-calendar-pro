# Initialization, Update, Reset, and Destroy

The `init()` method is the main method of the instance, which initiates the calendar's initialization process.

```js
const calendar = new VanillaCalendar(element, params);
calendar.init();
```

It's essential to note that you also have the ability to update the calendar with new settings at any time using the `update()` or `reset()` methods.

- The `update()` method allows you to apply new settings to the calendar while preserving the user-selected dates, month, and year after the update.
- The `reset()` method completely resets the calendar to its initial state, discarding any user-selected dates.

Example of usage:

```js
calendar.settings.lang = 'de-AT';
calendar.settings.iso8601 = false;

calendar.update();
// or
calendar.reset();
```

Additionally, if you want to completely remove the calendar instance, you can use the `destroy()` method.

Example of usage:

```js
calendar.destroy();
```

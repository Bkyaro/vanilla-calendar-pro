# Initialization, Update, and Reset

The `init()` method is the main method of the instance, which initiates the calendar's initialization process.

```js
const calendar = new VanillaCalendar(element, params);
calendar.init();
```

It's essential to note that you also have the ability to update the calendar with new settings at any time using the `update()` or `reset()` methods.

Unlike `reset()`, the `update()` method preserves the user-selected dates, month, and year after the update.

Example of usage:

```js
calendar.settings.lang = 'de-AT';
calendar.settings.iso8601 = false;

calendar.update();
// or
calendar.reset();
```

# Handling Click on a Day

Various actions are available for user interaction with the calendar, one of which is `clickDay()`. This action allows you to track the moment when a user clicks on a specific day in the calendar.

Example with logging the selected day to the console:

<Sandbox example="action-handlers-click-a-day" />

Please note that the selected day is represented as an array because the user can select not only one day but also a range of dates if allowed by the calendar parameters.

<Sandbox example="action-handlers-click-a-day-ranged" />

By default, an array of all selected dates is provided, which is logical. However, most of the time, you will want to obtain only the start and end dates.

To ensure that the dates are in the correct order, you can use the standard `.sort()` method:

```js
dates.sort((a, b) => +new Date(a) - +new Date(b))
```
